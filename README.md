# Movie-Archive-App
Movie Archive App Using Python with MovieDB API.

You can claim your own api from https://www.themoviedb.org.

I only added the "Next Page" function, you can always add "Previous Page" with creating a new function under the MovieDB class.

I believe searching with keywords only works with English words. Not sure though.

I saw that some of the key values like "name" or "title" can be different between the actual features so watch out for it.

And there was also a key value named "original_title" it's probably for non latin-alphabet.
